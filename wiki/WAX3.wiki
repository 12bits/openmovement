#summary WAX3 Wireless accelerometer

= WAX3 Wireless accelerometer =

The WAX3 wireless accelerometers allow movement data to be recorded and analyzed in real-time.  They can be used for decision making, control and lab-based experimentation.  Their ease of use and size makes them ideal for embedding into everyday objects.

They intelligently enter a power save mode when undisturbed for a configurable period.  When moved, their 3-axis MEMS accelerometer is sampled at a user-selectable frequency and sensitivity, and wirelessly transmitted to a receiver (at a configurable rate and channel).  

Each device can be used as a transmitter or receiver.  The WAX3 devices use a USB connection for receiving data into a PC, device configuration and battery recharge.
